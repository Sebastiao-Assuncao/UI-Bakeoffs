# User Interface Bakeoffs

## Bakeoff #1

**Challenge:**

Create a UI for a mobile app with different views of household consumption.

**Desired Result:**

A medium-fidelity prototype (implemented in figma.com) that allows the user to: 
1. Consult consumption history;
2. Consult real-time consumption;
3. Set consumption alerts.

**Functionality:**

The bake-off is an open design challenge. It is crucial to initiate an iteterive process of ideation-prototyping-test from day one. 
Using storyboards and paper prototypes is critical to be able to perform multiple iterations quickly. 3 iterations with a low-fidelity prototype (PBF) are expected.

## Bakeoff #2

**Challenge:**

Minimize the target selection time in an abstract interface

**Desired Result:**

A functional interface that minimizes the selection time of several circular targets in a 4x4 grid.

**Functionality:**

The solution must abide by these rules:

1. At a given moment, you can only access the current target, the next target and the previous target;
2. There cannot be invisible or unclickable;
3. The visual and hitbox size of each target must be 1.5cm and the grid must be on the center of the screen;
4. The cursor's movement cannot be changed in relation to the desired target;
5. Only a conventional mouse can be used;

## Bakeoff #3

**Challenge:**

Minimize the writing time on a smartwatch interface.

**Desired Result:**

An interface that minimizes the writing time on a smartwatch interface with a 4x4cm area.

**Functionality:**

The solution must abide by these rules:

1. The screen size must be 4x4cm and the input size 4x3cm. The layout of these areas **can** be changed;
2. The only way to simulate a tap has forcefully to be a left mouse button press;
3. Predictive text algorithm **can** be implemented.
